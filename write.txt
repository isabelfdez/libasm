In measure theory, a branch of mathematics, the Lebesgue measure, named after French mathematician Henri Lebesgue,
is the standard way of assigning a measure to subsets of n-dimensional Euclidean space. For n = 1, 2, or 3, it
coincides with the standard measure of length, area, or volume. In general, it is also called n-dimensional
volume, n-volume, or simply volume.[1] It is used throughout real analysis, in particular to define Lebesgue
integration. Sets that can be assigned a Lebesgue measure are called Lebesgue-measurable; the measure of the
Lebesgue-measurable set A is here denoted by Î»(A).
